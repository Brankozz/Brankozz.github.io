## About

I am **Ci Zhang**, a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the **University of Georgia (UGA)**, advised by **Prof. Geng Yuan**.

### Research Interests

My research focuses on:

- **Continual learning for large language models (LLMs)**
- **Diffusion models** and their applications

More broadly, I am interested in efficient and robust learning algorithms that allow modern generative models to adapt to new data and tasks over time without catastrophic forgetting.

### News

- Second-year Ph.D. student in CS at UGA.
- Actively exploring projects at the intersection of LLM continual learning and diffusion models.

### Contact

The best way to reach me is by email: **zhangci@uga.edu**.

If you would like, you can also reach out for potential collaborations related to LLMs, continual learning, or diffusion models.
